== Cross-cutting Concepts

.Content
This section describes crosscutting concepts (practices, patterns, regulations or solution ideas).
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks. 
They may include many different topics, such as the topics shown in the following diagram:

image::08-concepts-EN.drawio.png["Possible topics for crosscutting concepts"]

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

This is the place in the template that we provided for a cohesive specification of such concepts.

Many of these concepts relate to or influence several of your building blocks. 

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* example implementations,especially for technical concepts
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views

.Structure
Pick **only** the most-needed topics for your system and assign each a level-2 heading in this section (e.g. 8.1, 8.2 etc).

DO NOT ATTEMPT to cover all of the topics of the aforementioned diagram.


.Further Information

Some topics within systems often concern multiple building blocks, hardware elements or development processes.
It might be easier to communicate or document such _cross-cutting_ topics at a central location, instead of repeating them in the description of the concerned building blocks, hardware elements or development processes.

Certain concepts might concern **all** elements of a system, others might only be relevant for a few.
In the diagram above, logging concerns all three components, whereas security is relevant only for two components.

=== Domain Model

The system is based on a small set of core domain concepts:

* Course - represents a teaching unit managed by a tutor
* Student - represents a participant enrolled in a course
* Enrollment - represents the association between students and courses
* Submission - represents a CS50 assignment submission
* Grade - represents the evaluation result of a submission

=== Validation Concept

All incoming data is validated at the API layer before further processing.

* Request payloads are validated for structure and completeness
* Invalid data is rejected early with appropriate HTTP status codes
* Only validated domain objects are passed to application services

=== Error Handling Concept

Errors are handled consistently across the system.

* Client errors result in HTTP 4xx responses
* Server-side errors result in HTTP 5xx responses
* Error responses contain a clear message describing the problem

=== Authentication and Authorization Concept

Access to the system is restricted to authorized users.

* Tutors are allowed to manage courses, students, and grading
* External systems are accessed using secure credentials
* Authentication details are not exposed to the API clients

=== Integration Concept

External systems are integrated using dedicated adapters.

* CS50 integration handles submission and evaluation data import
* Moodle integration handles grade export
* GitHub integration is used optionally to resolve student identities

=== Persistence Concept

Data persistence is abstracted using repository interfaces.

* Application services depend only on repository abstractions
* Concrete database implementations can be replaced if required
* Persistence logic is separated from business logic

=== Logging and Traceability Concept

The system provides basic logging for important operations.

* Imports, grading operations, and exports are logged
* Errors are logged with contextual information
* Logs support debugging and traceability of grading decisions
