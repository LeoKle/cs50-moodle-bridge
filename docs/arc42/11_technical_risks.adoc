== Risks and Technical Debts


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/[Risks and Technical Debt] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Changes in External APIs

*Risk:*  
CS50, Moodle, or GitHub APIs may change their interfaces or data formats.

*Impact:*  
Importing submissions or exporting grades may fail or produce incorrect results.

*Mitigation:*  

* Use dedicated integration adapters for each external system
* Validate incoming data strictly
* Isolate API-specific logic to minimize impact of changes

=== Availability of External Systems

*Risk:*  
External systems such as Moodle or CS50 may be temporarily unavailable.

*Impact:*  
Grade import or export operations may fail.

*Mitigation:*  

* Detect and report communication errors clearly
* Store grading results locally before export
* Allow retrying failed operations

=== Incorrect Grading Logic

*Risk:*  
Errors in grading rules may lead to incorrect evaluation results.

*Impact:*  
Students may receive wrong grades.

*Mitigation:*  

* Keep grading logic isolated in dedicated services
* Use clear and traceable grading rules
* Validate grading results before export

=== Data Consistency Issues

*Risk:*  
Repeated imports or partial failures could lead to inconsistent data.

*Impact:*  
Grades or submissions may be duplicated or overwritten incorrectly.

*Mitigation:*  

* Use idempotent import and export operations
* Ensure repeated processing produces identical results
* Validate data consistency before persistence

=== Security of Credentials

*Risk:*  
Credentials for CS50, Moodle, or GitHub could be exposed or misused.

*Impact:*  
Unauthorized access to external systems or sensitive data.

*Mitigation:*  

* Store credentials outside the source code
* Use environment variables for configuration
* Restrict access to sensitive configuration files

=== Performance Limitations

*Risk:*  
Large courses with many students and submissions may degrade performance.

*Impact:*  
Slow import, grading, or export operations.

*Mitigation:*  

* Use efficient data processing strategies
* Optimize batch operations
* Monitor performance during large imports
