== Deployment View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence a system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section one can
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/[Deployment View] in the arc42 documentation.

Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

* distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between them
* important justifications or motivations for this deployment structure
* quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure
* mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

Here you can include the internal structure of (some) infrastructure elements from level 1.

Please copy the structure from level 1 for each selected element.

=== Runtime Environment

The backend application runs in the following environment:

* Application runtime: Python-based web service
* Web framework: FastAPI
* Execution environment: Local server or containerized deployment
* Network communication: HTTPS

The application exposes REST-based API endpoint for all core functionalities.

=== Deployment Nodes

The system is deployed across the following nodes:

* Client Node  
  Used by tutors to manage courses, students, and grading.

* Backend Server  
  Hosts the CS50–Moodle Bridge Application and its API.

* Database Server  
  Stores courses, students, submissions, and grading results.

* External Systems  
  CS50 system, Moodle platform, and GitHub API.

  === Communication Paths

The following communication paths exist:

* Client → Backend Server  
  HTTP requests for course management, student import,
  enrollment, submission upload, and grading.

* Backend Server → Database Server  
  Persistent storage and retrieval of application data.

* Backend Server → CS50 System  
  Import of submission and evaluation data.

* Backend Server → Moodle  
  Export of grading results.

* Backend Server → GitHub  
  Optional resolution of student identities.

All external communication is performed over HTTPS.

=== Deployment Constraints

The deployment is subject to the following constraints:

* External system availability cannot be guaranteed
* Network latency may affect import and export operations
* Authentication credentials must be securely managed
