.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/[Solution Strategy] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Overall Strategy

The system follows a layered architecture:

* API layer for HTTP communication
* Application logic layer for grading and data processing
* Integration layer for external systems (CS50, Moodle, GitHub)
* Persistence layer for storing submissions and results

=== Communication Strategy

All communication is performed via REST-based HTTP APIs.

* CS50 data is imported via file upload or API-based export
* Moodle is updated by exporting structured grading data
* The backend exposes JSON-based endpoints for the web UI

=== Integration Strategy

External systems are accessed through dedicated adapter components.

* CS50 integration handles submission data import
* Moodle integration handles grade export
* GitHub integration resolves student identities

=== Persistence Strategy

Submissions and grading results are stored using a repository abstraction.

* Domain logic depends only on repository interfaces
* The concrete database technology can be changed without affecting business logic
